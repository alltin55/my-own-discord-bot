# my-own-discord-bot

A few years ago, I developed a unique bot using Discord API Version 1.7.8. This bot stood out due to its advanced features, most notably an anti-spam system that wasn't publicly available at the time and probably still isn't. This system effectively prevented spammers from raiding servers by utilizing various methods to identify and track different types of spam behavior. Creating such a sophisticated system was uncommon and typically only found in well-known bots with at least 2000 users. Remarkably, I achieved this without any users and at a time when I wasn't very experienced.

Additionally, the bot had capabilities that allowed it to adapt and improve its spam detection algorithms over time. It could differentiate between genuine user activity and malicious spamming tactics, ensuring that the server remained a safe and engaging environment for all members. This project not only showcased my ability to tackle complex problems but also highlighted my commitment to creating secure and efficient solutions in the world of programming.
